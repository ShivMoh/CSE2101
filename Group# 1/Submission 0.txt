SE2101 Software Engineering - Semester Project
Organization: Ministry of Education: Secondary Education 
Problem: Schools in Guyana (and by extention the educationn sector) are still making use of manual record keeping. 
This makes it extremely difficult to store, retrieve, share and have effective coordination and information distribution. 

Aim: To create and develop an information system which allows for storing and sharing of school records such as teacher and student attendance and bio information, 
teaching schemes, academic achievements, organisational records etc. 

Overview
As concerned citizens and former students of the public education system, it is very often It is observed that public schools in Guyana, especially secondary schools, 
rely solely on physical registers to document studentsâ€™ attendance,punctuality and academic advancement. This way, it is very easy for attendance and academic advancement
not  to be taken due to a class teacher's absence for example. More so, there is a wide range of flexibility when Assessing punctuality and academic advancements for 
nearly 30 students in a classroom, for example. 
By creating a digital database system, students' attendance punctuality and academic advancement could be manually recorded by assigning an identification card or a 
unique pin code to enter into the data collecting hardware or even a biometric system setup upon arriving at school. The system would also record the students time of 
arrival, to later compute the students overall punctuality and grades attained. At the end of a set period example, weekly, monthly or termly, the students' attendance,
punctuality and academic advancement could be assessed by authorities or even parents  in the school for necessary reward or discipline actions. 
This database system would also facilitate easy access to relavant records by the ministry of education on termly and annual basis for school and teacher assessments.
